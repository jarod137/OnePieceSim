# Running webTest.py

## Using docker

### The docker script is not working right now. Run as normal python file. Working on fix. 

~~In order to run the script you need to have docker 
installed on your computer. Then you need to also be in the
```OnePieceSim/WebScraper``` directory. Once all that is correct,
you could run the commands~~

~~```docker compose build```~~

then

```docker compose up```


## Regular script
You could also just run the python file like a normal file. 
The only thing to note is that it will NOT be outputted 
to the correct directory like it would if you ran it using docker. 

CMD
```python webTest.py```
